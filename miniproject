            <h2>Additional Morning Tips</h2>
            <h4>Healthy Snacks</h4>
            <p>Consider having a small, nutritious snack if you have a long gap between breakfast and lunch.
                Opt for fruits, nuts, or yogurt. These snacks can help maintain energy levels throughout the
                morning and prevent overeating during later meals. They also provide essential vitamins,
                minerals, and fiber necessary for a balanced diet.</p>
            <h4>Quality Sleep</h4>
            <p>Ensure you get adequate sleep each night. Create a relaxing bedtime routine and maintain a
                consistent sleep schedule. Quality sleep is essential for physical and mental health, and it
                contributes significantly to your overall well-being and productivity throughout the day. Avoid
                screens and caffeine close to bedtime and aim for 7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep.</p>
            <h4>Productive Environment</h4>
            <p>Prepare your workspace or to-do list the night before to kickstart a productive morning without
                feeling overwhelmed. A clutter-free and organized environment can help reduce stress levels
                and increase focus, allowing you to tackle tasks more efficiently. Additionally, ensure your
                workspace has proper lighting and is ergonomically set up to promote a comfortable and
                productive work atmosphere.</p>
